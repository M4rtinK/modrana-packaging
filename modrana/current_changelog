- fix tile loading from local storage
 - I've apparently managed to break it in the previous version :P
- make tile loading from local storage more robust
 - it is now file extension independent 
  - modRana will fetch any suitable image for the given tile coordinates
  - this should prevent stored images from becoming inaccessible it layer extension changes
 - modRana now detects if the tile that has been loaded is not an image
  - all such cases are now logged
  - for files modRana tries to find another file with the same coordinates that is an image
- improved log messages for tile loading debugging
