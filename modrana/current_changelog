* layer timeout support (Frederic Ferner)
 * dynamic map layers (traffic, weather, etc.) now automatically load new tiles once the oled ones time out
 * not yet handles staring at the same part of map for hours
 * you need to move the map a bit so that the tiles are requested again & refetched
* support for setting network usage mode in Qt 5 GUI (Frederic Ferner)
 * max - unlimited network usage
 * minimal - no automatic tile download
* Thanks a lot to Frederic for these nice two patches! :)
* fix text sizing on icon grid
* fix compass rose display with qrc (Android)
 * it still does not rotate on Android some reason :)
