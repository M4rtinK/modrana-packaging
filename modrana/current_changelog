- generate correct (Python 3.4) bytecode for the Sailfish OS package
 - makes modRana Python part startup almost 2 times faster (~3.8s->~2s) ! :)
- make location and map page in Qt 5 GUI asynchronous
 - this should make the startup even faster and more seemless
- add a fade in & out animation for the startup indicator in Qt 5 GUI
