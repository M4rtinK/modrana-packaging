 - unlike before, log messages are both in log file _and_ in console
 - and the Qt 5 GUI even forwards all log messages to the Python log :)
 - the log file can be enabled and disabled from the Qt 5 GUI
 - there is also full path to the log displayed in the Qt 5 GUI
- it is now possible to use the volume rocker for map zoom on Sailfish OS
- the Options->Map screen in QT 5 GUI now shows path to the map data folder and free space in the folder
- it is now possible to tell modRana to always start in fullscreen
- it is now posible to tell modRana to always show a quit button in the main menu in GTK GUI
- tunables have been exportend for various modRana mechanisms in the GTK GUI
 - the main aim is to enable users to debug or workaround crashes that have been reported on the N900
