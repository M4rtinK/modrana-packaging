This folder stores files used for making modRana packages for Android.

The currently used project is in the modrana-android folder, which is
a Git subtree.

The old android-project folder called old_android-project is a git submodule, 
if you have just cloned the modRana packaging repository and you want to use it,
you need to run:

git submodule init
git submodule update

So that the submodule is properly initialized and updated.
