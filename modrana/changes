* Thu May 09 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.41.2
- fix modRana not showing monav routing data packs
- if map folder path is redirected by config file option, the monav routing data folder is also using the redirected path
- new option for disabling (almost) all animations in QML GUI
 - the option is in Options->UI
 - when enabled, page switching becomes ridiculously fast, even on the N900 :)
 - dialog animations are still ON, as there doesn't seem to be a clear way of switching them OFF
* Sat May 04 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.41.1
- modRana is now Python 3 compatible
 - Python 2.5 compatibility was of course preserved
 - as a result, modRana still works just fine with Python 2.5 on the N900
 - Python 3 compatibility should enable packaging modRana for BlackBerry 10
- Android compatibility
 - modRana with the QML GUI now works on Android
 - Android device module has been added
 - installable APKs are available
 - APK generation script was added to the modRana packaging scripts
 - map data are stored in /sdcard/modrana/maps
- QML GUI improvements
 - theme switching support
 - night theme for the QML GUI
 - the menu button can now show current mode, as in GTK GUI
 - thanks to Wikiwide for the idea & icons ! :)
 - finally some buttons in Options (related to theme switching & menu icon configuration)
 - fixed centering to the middle of the Atlantic at startup (center on Brno instead :) )
 - fixed main map icon now shows only one map layer
- automatic tile downloading in GTK GUI should now be faster due to connection reuse provided by Urllib 3
- new POI icon
- various fixes
* Sun Apr 14 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.3
- GTK GUI: pottentially faster automatic & batch tile download
 - and other activities, such as online lookups, that use threads
 - looks like gobject.init_threads() and gtk.init_threads() was not called before gtk.main()
 - as result, Python threads might have run only when some GTK events happened
 - this would explain why modRana sometimes downloaded tiles slower with blanked screen
- QML GUI: new nested map laer selection dialog that shows all layers
 - it now shares with the GTK GUI the same data model
 - as result, both GUI now should show the same list of layers
* Tue Mar 26 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.2
- add new coordinate substitution method for layers using quadtree/quadkey addressing
- add the VE UKOS layer
* Sun Mar 24 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.1
- map overlay support in QML GUI
 - based on a patch by Wikiwide - thanks ! :)
 - multiple overlays can be used at the same time
 - per-layer opacity setting
 - nice overlay configuration UI
 - there is no hard limit on number of overlays at once
  - too many layers at once might slow down the application though :)
 - overlay configuration is not yet persistent
- pretty print map layer loading status
 - also make sure they don't overlap when overlays are used
- long back-button press now returns to map screen
- some new map layers were added to the QML map layer selector
 - eventually it should use the same layer list as the GTK GUI
- fix some warnings at startup
- theme and mode are now exposed by the "modrana" QML context property
