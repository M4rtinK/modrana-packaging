* Tue Jan 28 2014 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.44.3
- add missing libsailfishapp-launcher depency (provides the sailfish-qml utility)
* Sun Jan 26 2014 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.44.2
- device modules now can override profile folder path
 - and also cache folder path
- use XDG paths when running on Sailfish OS
 - main pofile is now in ~/.config/modrana
 - maps, routing data, POIs and tracklogs are in ~/.local/share/modrana

* Fri Jan 24 2014 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.44.1
- added new Qt5+PyOtherSide based GUI
 - supports multiple QML components sets as backends
 - the Silica component set can be used on Sailfish to provide a native look
 - the Controls set, a post 5.1 Qt built-in, can be used on desktop and elsewhere
 - the GUI is almost fully asynchornous so it should be even more repsonsive than the Qt4 QML GUI
 - much shorter startup time due to PyOtherSide usage
 - based on QtQuick 2.0, so fully hardware accelerated
- new theme named Silica
 - primarily aimed for use on Sailfish OS, but can be also used to provide a slight Sailfish like look on other platforms
- more white monochromatic icons for the Silica and Night themes
- Jolla device module
* Mon Sep 30 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.43.4
- fix python-protobuf dependency
 - looks newer version is needed for Monav routing server
- only import Monav support once actually needed
 - should shorten startup a little bit
 - in case Monav support fails to load, the route module should still load fine
- use conic based connectivity detection on Fremantle
* Sun Sep 29 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.43.3
- don't crash if a filesystem path can't be created
- fix online routing not respecting route parameters
 - current mode is now correctly taken into account
 - "avoid highways" and "avoid toll roads" works correctly again
- convert Wikipedia search to the new asynchronous provider framework
- convert local search to the new asynchronous provider framework
- address, wikipedia and local search wait for Internet connectivity
 - and enable it if needed
- local search also waits for GPS, if needed
 - and will enable it, provided it is not turned of in options
- local search now intializes GPS and Internet in parallel
 - this should speed up local search triggered from CLI
 - provided GPS and Internet is not yet initialized when triggered
- CLI search debugging option
 - disables stdout suppression
- add (hopefully) cross platform connectivity checking
- the "search" button in the Fremantle app menu on the N900 now goes to the main search page
- the modRana standard output now contains current Python version during startup

- modRana now uses 4 space indentation :)
* Sat Jul 13 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.42.1
- add batch tile redownload & update
 - accessible from the "Edit" submenu in batch dl menu
 - redownload ON -> download all tiles, even when locally available
 - redownload OFF (default) -> download only tiles that are not locally available
 - redownload update -> download only tiles that ARE locally available
- add 32bit (i386) Monav routing server binary by jperon - Thanks !
 - this should make offline routing on 32bit x86 machines possible
- preliminary support for high DPI screens in QML GUI
- fix online routing not respecting directions language
- fix tracebacks with some routes from Monav offline routing
* Thu May 09 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.41.2
- fix modRana not showing monav routing data packs
- if map folder path is redirected by config file option, the monav routing data folder is also using the redirected path
- new option for disabling (almost) all animations in QML GUI
 - the option is in Options->UI
 - when enabled, page switching becomes ridiculously fast, even on the N900 :)
 - dialog animations are still ON, as there doesn't seem to be a clear way of switching them OFF
* Sat May 04 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.41.1
- modRana is now Python 3 compatible
 - Python 2.5 compatibility was of course preserved

 - Python 3 compatibility should enable packaging modRana for BlackBerry 10
- Android compatibility
 - modRana with the QML GUI now works on Android
 - Android device module has been added

 - fixed centering to the middle of the Atlantic at startup (center on Brno instead :) )
 - fixed main map icon now shows only one map layer
- automatic tile downloading in GTK GUI should now be faster due to connection reuse provided by Urllib 3
- new POI icon
- various fixes
* Sun Apr 14 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.3
- GTK GUI: pottentially faster automatic & batch tile download
 - and other activities, such as online lookups, that use threads
 - looks like gobject.init_threads() and gtk.init_threads() was not called before gtk.main()
 - as result, Python threads might have run only when some GTK events happened
 - this would explain why modRana sometimes downloaded tiles slower with blanked screen
- QML GUI: new nested map laer selection dialog that shows all layers
 - it now shares with the GTK GUI the same data model
 - as result, both GUI now should show the same list of layers
* Tue Mar 26 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.2
- add new coordinate substitution method for layers using quadtree/quadkey addressing
- add the VE UKOS layer
* Sun Mar 24 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.1
- map overlay support in QML GUI
 - based on a patch by Wikiwide - thanks ! :)
 - multiple overlays can be used at the same time
 - per-layer opacity setting
 - nice overlay configuration UI
 - there is no hard limit on number of overlays at once
  - too many layers at once might slow down the application though :)
 - overlay configuration is not yet persistent
- pretty print map layer loading status
 - also make sure they don't overlap when overlays are used
- long back-button press now returns to map screen
- some new map layers were added to the QML map layer selector
 - eventually it should use the same layer list as the GTK GUI
- fix some warnings at startup
- theme and mode are now exposed by the "modrana" QML context property
