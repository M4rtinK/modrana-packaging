* Sun Apr 14 2013 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.40.3
- GTK GUI: pottentially faster automatic & batch tile download
 - and other activities, such as online lookups, that use threads
 - looks like gobject.init_threads() and gtk.init_threads() was not called before gtk.main()
 - as result, Python threads might have run only when some GTK events happened
 - this would explain why modRana sometimes downloaded tiles slower with blanked screen
- QML GUI: new nested map laer selection dialog that shows all layers
 - it now shares with the GTK GUI the same data model
 - as result, both GUI now should show the same list of layers

 - based on a patch by Wikiwide - thanks ! :)
 - multiple overlays can be used at the same time
 - per-layer opacity setting
 - nice overlay configuration UI
 - there is no hard limit on number of overlays at once
  - too many layers at once might slow down the application though :)
 - overlay configuration is not yet persistent
- pretty print map layer loading status
 - also make sure they don't overlap when overlays are used
- long back-button press now returns to map screen
- some new map layers were added to the QML map layer selector
 - eventually it should use the same layer list as the GTK GUI
- fix some warnings at startup
